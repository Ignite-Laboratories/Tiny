### A helper package for working at the bit level in Go

Some of the bit ranges already have defined terms, but I've filled in the gaps with as fitting of terms as I could find.

| Width  | Range  |  Name   |
|:------:|:------:|:-------:|
|   1    |  0-1   |   Bit   |
|   2    |  0-3   |  Crumb  |
|   3    |  0-7   |  Note   |
|   4    |  0-15  | Nibble  |
|   5    |  0-31  |  Flake  |
|   6    |  0-63  | Morsel  |
|   7    | 0-127  |  Shred  |
